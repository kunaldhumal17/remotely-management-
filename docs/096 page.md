# ***Chapter 27 : Establishing Team Norms and Values ***


### **Encouraging Cross-Functional Collaboration**

Encouraging cross-functional collaboration enables remote team members to leverage diverse skills and expertise from different areas of the organization, fostering innovation and problem-solving. Remote managers should facilitate opportunities for remote team members to collaborate with colleagues from other departments or functional areas on projects or initiatives. Encourage cross-functional teams to share knowledge, exchange ideas, and work together towards common goals. Additionally, provide platforms or forums where remote team members can connect with counterparts in other departments to foster relationships and collaboration. By encouraging cross-functional collaboration, remote managers can break down organizational silos, promote knowledge sharing, and drive collective success across the organization.

### **Promoting Diversity of Thought and Perspective**

Promoting diversity of thought and perspective fosters creativity, innovation, and resilience within remote teams by encouraging the exploration of different ideas, approaches, and viewpoints. Remote managers should create an inclusive environment where remote team members feel empowered to express their opinions, challenge assumptions, and contribute their unique perspectives to discussions and decision-making processes. Encourage remote team members to actively seek out diverse viewpoints, engage in constructive dialogue, and consider alternative perspectives when solving problems or making decisions. By promoting diversity of thought and perspective, remote managers can stimulate creativity, improve decision-making, and drive innovation within the team.

### **Fostering Psychological Safety**

Fostering psychological safety creates an environment where remote team members feel safe to take risks, be vulnerable, and express themselves without fear of judgment or reprisal, fostering trust and collaboration within the team. Remote managers should cultivate a culture of openness, empathy, and respect where remote team members feel valued and supported. Encourage remote team members to share their ideas, ask questions, and voice their concerns openly and honestly. Additionally, lead by example by demonstrating vulnerability, admitting mistakes, and actively listening to remote team members' perspectives. By fostering psychological safety, remote managers can create a supportive and inclusive team environment where remote team members feel empowered to contribute their best work and collaborate effectively towards shared goals.

### **Empowering Distributed Leadership**

Empowering distributed leadership enables remote team members to take initiative, make decisions, and lead projects or initiatives autonomously, fostering a culture of empowerment and accountability within the team. Remote managers should delegate responsibilities and authority to remote team members based on their skills, expertise, and interests, and provide them with the support and resources they need to succeed in their roles. Encourage remote team members to step up as leaders, take ownership of projects, and mentor their peers. Additionally, recognize and celebrate the contributions of remote team members who demonstrate leadership qualities and drive positive change within the team. By empowering distributed leadership, remote managers can harness the full potential of remote team members, drive innovation, and foster a culture of collaboration and excellence within the team.

### **Embracing Flexibility and Adaptability**

Embracing flexibility and adaptability enables remote teams to respond effectively to change, uncertainty, and evolving priorities, fostering resilience and agility within the team. Remote managers should encourage remote team members to embrace flexibility in their approach to work, adapt to changing circumstances, and experiment with new ways of working. Provide remote team members with the autonomy and support they need to adjust their workflows, schedules, or priorities as needed. Additionally, lead by example by demonstrating flexibility in your own work and communication with remote team members. By embracing flexibility and adaptability, remote managers can empower remote team members to navigate challenges, seize opportunities, and thrive in dynamic and uncertain environments.
