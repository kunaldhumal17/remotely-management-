# ***Chapter 16 : Understanding Equity and Fairness ***

### **Addressing Systemic Inequities and Structural Barriers**

Addressing systemic inequities and structural barriers involves recognizing and addressing the root causes of inequality and injustice that may exist within the organization or broader society.
