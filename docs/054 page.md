Certainly! Let's expand Chapter 15 with additional points:

---

### **Encouraging Allyship and Advocacy**

Encouraging allyship and advocacy empowers remote team members to actively support and amplify the voices of marginalized or underrepresented colleagues within the team. Encourage remote team members to educate themselves on issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion and to use their privilege and influence to advocate for marginalized groups. Foster a culture where remote team members feel empowered to speak up against discrimination, bias, and injustice and to actively promote equity and fairness within the team.

### **Promoting Accessibility and Inclusive Design**

Promoting accessibility and inclusive design ensures that remote team members of all abilities can fully participate and contribute to team activities and initiatives. Provide accessible tools, technologies, and communication channels that accommodate diverse needs and preferences, such as screen readers, captioning, and alternative formats. Incorporate principles of inclusive design into team processes and practices to ensure that remote team members with disabilities are not excluded or disadvantaged.
