# ***Chapter 12 : Managing Conflict and Resolving Disputes in Remote Teams***


### **Encouraging Collaborative Problem-Solving**

Encouraging collaborative problem-solving involves engaging remote team members in joint efforts to identify root causes of conflicts and develop solutions collaboratively. Facilitate brainstorming sessions or problem-solving workshops where remote team members can work together to analyze conflicts, explore alternative perspectives, and generate creative solutions. Emphasize the importance of collaboration, cooperation, and teamwork in finding sustainable resolutions to conflicts within the team.

### **Providing Conflict Resolution Resources**

Providing conflict resolution resources equips remote team members with practical tools and materials to navigate conflicts effectively. Offer access to conflict resolution guides, templates, and worksheets that remote team members can use to structure their conflict resolution efforts. Provide examples of successful conflict resolution scenarios and best practices to inspire and guide remote team members in addressing conflicts proactively and constructively.

### **Promoting Accountability and Ownership**

Promoting accountability and ownership encourages remote team members to take responsibility for their actions and contributions to conflicts within the team. Encourage remote team members to reflect on their roles in conflicts, acknowledge their impact on others, and take proactive steps to address any harm or misunderstandings. Foster a culture where remote team members hold themselves and each other accountable for maintaining positive relationships and resolving conflicts collaboratively.

### **Offering Conflict Coaching and Support**

Offering conflict coaching and support provides individualized guidance and assistance to remote team members who may struggle with managing conflicts effectively. Assign a trained conflict coach or mentor to provide one-on-one support, feedback, and guidance to remote team members involved in conflicts. Offer resources such as self-assessment tools, reflection prompts, and coping strategies to help remote team members develop their conflict resolution skills and resilience.

### **Implementing Restorative Practices**

Implementing restorative practices focuses on repairing harm, restoring relationships, and rebuilding trust within remote teams following conflicts. Facilitate restorative circles or dialogues where remote team members affected by conflicts can come together to share their perspectives, express their feelings, and work towards resolution and reconciliation. Encourage empathy, active listening, and accountability as key principles of restorative practices within the team.
