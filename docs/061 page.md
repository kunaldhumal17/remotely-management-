# ***Chapter 16 : Promoting Equity and Fairness in Remote Teams***


### **Promoting Supplier Diversity and Equity**

Promoting supplier diversity and equity involves ensuring that the organization's procurement practices reflect a commitment to equity, fairness, and inclusivity. Remote managers should advocate for supplier diversity policies that prioritize contracting with diverse suppliers, including minority-owned, women-owned, LGBTQ+-owned, and veteran-owned businesses. Collaborate with procurement teams to establish supplier diversity goals, track progress, and implement strategies to promote equity and inclusion in supplier relationships.

### **Encouraging Civic Engagement and Social Responsibility**

Encouraging civic engagement and social responsibility empowers remote team members to contribute to positive social change and advocate for equity and fairness beyond the workplace. Remote managers should support and encourage remote team members to engage in volunteerism, advocacy, or community service activities that align with their values and interests. Foster a culture where remote team members feel empowered to use their voices and talents to make a difference in their communities and promote social justice and equity.

### **Addressing Systemic Inequities and Structural Barriers**

Addressing systemic inequities and structural barriers involves recognizing and addressing the root causes of inequality and injustice that may exist within the organization or broader society. Remote managers should advocate for systemic changes that dismantle barriers to equity and fairness, such as biased hiring practices, unequal access to resources, or discriminatory policies. Collaborate with organizational leaders and stakeholders to identify and address systemic inequities and implement policies and practices that promote equity, diversity, and inclusion at all levels of the organization.

### **Monitoring and Accountability Mechanisms**

Implementing monitoring and accountability mechanisms ensures that progress towards equity and fairness goals is tracked, measured, and evaluated over time. Remote managers should establish clear metrics, targets, and key performance indicators (KPIs) related to equity and fairness initiatives and regularly monitor progress against these benchmarks. Hold individuals and teams accountable for achieving equity and fairness goals, and be transparent about successes, challenges, and areas for improvement.
