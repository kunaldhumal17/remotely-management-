# ***Chapter 16 : Promoting Equity and Fairness in Remote Teams***


### **Promoting Supplier Diversity and Equity**

Promoting supplier diversity and equity involves ensuring that the organization's procurement practices reflect a commitment to equity, fairness, and inclusivity. Remote managers should advocate for supplier diversity policies that prioritize contracting with diverse suppliers, including minority-owned, women-owned, LGBTQ+-owned, and veteran-owned businesses. Collaborate with procurement teams to establish supplier diversity goals, track progress, and implement strategies to promote equity and inclusion in supplier relationships.

### **Encouraging Civic Engagement and Social Responsibility**

Encouraging civic engagement and social responsibility empowers remote team members to contribute to positive social change and advocate for equity and fairness beyond the workplace. Remote managers should support and encourage remote team members to engage in volunteerism, advocacy, or community service activities that align with their values and interests. Foster a culture where remote team members feel empowered to use their voices and talents to make a difference in their communities and promote social justice and equity.

### **Addressing Systemic Inequities and Structural Barriers**

Addressing systemic inequities and structural barriers involves recognizing and addressing the root causes of inequality and injustice that may exist within the organization or broader society. Remote managers should advocate for systemic changes that dismantle barriers to equity and fairness, such as biased hiring practices, unequal access to resources, or discriminatory policies. Collaborate with organizational leaders and stakeholders to identify and address systemic inequities and implement policies and practices that promote equity, diversity, and inclusion at all levels of the organization.

### **Monitoring and Accountability Mechanisms**

Implementing monitoring and accountability mechanisms ensures that progress towards equity and fairness goals is tracked, measured, and evaluated over time. Remote managers should establish clear metrics, targets, and key performance indicators (KPIs) related to equity and fairness initiatives and regularly monitor progress against these benchmarks. Hold individuals and teams accountable for achieving equity and fairness goals, and be transparent about successes, challenges, and areas for improvement.

### **Promoting Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing**

Promoting collaboration and knowledge sharing encourages remote team members to work together, leverage each other's strengths, and share expertise and insights to achieve common goals. Remote managers should create opportunities for collaborative work through virtual meetings, brainstorming sessions, and collaborative tools and platforms. Foster a culture of knowledge sharing where remote team members freely exchange ideas, best practices, and lessons learned to drive innovation and continuous improvement within the team.

### **Providing Support and Recognition**

Providing support and recognition reinforces trust and cohesion within remote teams by acknowledging and appreciating the contributions and efforts of team members. Remote managers should offer support and encouragement to remote team members, providing resources, guidance, and mentorship to help them overcome challenges and achieve their goals. Recognize and celebrate the achievements and milestones of remote team members publicly, acknowledging their hard work and dedication to the team's success.

### **Resolving Conflict and Addressing Issues**

Resolving conflict and addressing issues promptly and effectively is essential for maintaining trust and cohesion within remote teams. Remote managers should be proactive in addressing conflicts and issues that arise within the team, facilitating open and honest dialogue to understand different perspectives and find mutually acceptable solutions. Encourage remote team members to address conflicts constructively and respectfully, focusing on finding solutions rather than assigning blame.

### **Cultivating a Positive and Supportive Culture**

Cultivating a positive and supportive culture fosters trust, collaboration, and cohesion within remote teams by creating a work environment where remote team members feel valued, respected, and empowered to succeed. Remote managers should lead by example, modeling positive behaviors such as empathy, kindness, and inclusivity in their interactions with team members. Foster a culture of appreciation and support where remote team members feel comfortable asking for help, sharing ideas, and taking risks to innovate and grow.

### **Conclusion**
