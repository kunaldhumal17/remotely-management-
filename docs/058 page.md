# ***Chapter 16 : Understanding Equity and Fairness ***

### **Promoting Inclusive Leadership Behaviors**

Promoting inclusive leadership behaviors involves modeling behaviors that prioritize fairness, equity, and inclusion within remote teams. Remote managers should lead by example, demonstrating empathy, fairness, and transparency in their interactions with team members. Encourage remote managers to actively seek out and incorporate diverse perspectives in decision-making processes, advocate for equity and fairness in all aspects of team operations, and foster a culture where every team member feels valued and respected.

### **Creating Opportunities for Career Advancement**

Creating opportunities for career advancement ensures that remote team members have access to opportunities for professional growth and development regardless of their background or identity. Remote managers should actively identify and cultivate talent within the team, providing opportunities for skill development, mentorship, and leadership roles. Implement transparent career pathways and promotion criteria to ensure that career advancement opportunities are accessible to all remote team members based on their skills, contributions, and potential.

### **Ensuring Accessibility in Remote Work Practices**

Ensuring accessibility in remote work practices involves removing barriers and providing accommodations to ensure that remote team members with disabilities can fully participate and contribute. Remote managers should assess remote work tools, platforms, and communication channels for accessibility and provide accommodations such as screen readers, captioning, or alternative formats as needed. Foster a culture where remote team members feel comfortable requesting accommodations and where their needs are respected and addressed promptly.

### **Promoting Supplier Diversity and Equity**

Promoting supplier diversity and equity involves ensuring that the organization's procurement practices reflect a commitment to equity, fairness, and inclusivity. Remote managers should advocate for supplier diversity policies that prioritize contracting with diverse suppliers, including minority-owned, women-owned, LGBTQ+-owned, and veteran-owned businesses. Collaborate with procurement teams to establish supplier diversity goals, track progress, and implement strategies to promote equity and inclusion in supplier relationships.

### **Encouraging Civic Engagement and Social Responsibility**

Encouraging civic engagement and social responsibility empowers remote team members to contribute to positive social change and advocate for equity and fairness beyond the workplace. Remote managers should support and encourage remote team members to engage in volunteerism, advocacy, or community service activities that align with their values and interests. Foster a culture where remote team members feel empowered to use their voices and talents to make a difference in their communities and promote social justice and equity.
